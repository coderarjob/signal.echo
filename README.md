## About

This is a hardware project based on Atmega8A microcontroller. This project came about from a
personal need for a demo board to test my new oscilloscope. I plan to create a complete PCB
along with firmware in this repo.

**Note**: This is the release branch for version 1.x. Work on the next version is done in the master
branch.

### Goals

- [X] Firmware: RS232 sample output (positive)
- [X] Firmware: I2C sample output
- [X] Firmware: Runt pulse (+ve & -ve runt pulses)
- [X] Firmware: Sine wave pattern
- [X] Firmware: Amplitude Modulation wave pattern
- [X] Firmware: Triangle wave pattern
- [X] Firmware: Sawtooth wave pattern
- [X] Firmware: Burst data in two lines
- [X] Firmware: Separate arch independent codes
- [X] Unittests: Add unittests for utils
- [X] Unittests: Add unittests for existing tests
- [X] Manufacturing: Build the PCB board

## Building prerequisites

1. Requires Linux environment for building.
2. GNU Make
3. avr-gcc
4. avr-libc

### Firmware

```
BUILD_DIR=out make
```

Firmware is the `./out/firmware.hex` file. To program micro with avrdude, we can do `make program`.

### Unittests

We can build every unittests and run them using the `run` target.

```
BUILD=ut BUILD_DIR=out/ut make run
```

### Tools

Some tools which are used exclusively in this project are/will be put into the `tools` folder. Each
may have different prerequisites and build procedures. For information see `Readme.md` of each
tool.
